## Description

Sushi Junai's web app is an interactive menu for the restaurant's all-you-can-eat customers. Diners can add items to their order summary, see the amount those items would've cost, and calculate tip. A timer shows diners how long they have left in their two hour all-you-can-eat dining time. Diners also have the option to create an account and save menu items to their favorites for easy access the next time they dine at Sushi Junai.

Along with the interactive menu element, this app also functions as Sushi Junai's basic website, complete with hours, contact information, links to make reservations and order online, and a static version of the menu.
